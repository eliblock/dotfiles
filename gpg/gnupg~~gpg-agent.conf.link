## Unless another option file is specified (with the --options flag), GnuPG
## Agent uses this file (~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf).
##
## Configuration heavily based on:
## https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/gpg-agent.conf

# program used for pin entry (installed via brew)
# gpg-agent expects pinentry to be in different places on various OSs, and
# furthermore we want to use pinentry-mac which brew installs to different
# places depending on the machine's cpu
#
# we set up a symlink at pinentry-dotfile-custom which points to the proper
# local pinentry-mac installation. Use that symlink!
pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-dotfile-custom

# how long (in seconds) a password is cached before it must be re-entered. The
# timer is reset to this value each time the cached password is used
default-cache-ttl 600
# maximum time (in seconds) a password may be cached, even if its cache ttl
## timer has been reset
max-cache-ttl 7200
